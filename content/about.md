### I'm **Aleksandr Tihomirov**, a **Golang backend developer** and **Cloud enthusiast** based in Europe.

Today I engineer and design apps and websites from the ground up using Go for backend and Vue.js for frontend.

Also in my free time I maintain [DTinker](https://discord.gg/EDwd5wr) community and experiment with different technologies.
